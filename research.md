> Are you a current **UW undergrad or CSE B.S./M.S. student** interested in working with me? Read this Allen School page on [Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/enrichment/research) and then email me about why you're interested in working on CS Education research with me.
>
> Are you a current or prospective **Ph.D student** interested in working with me? I do not formally advise Ph.D students, but we have a vibrant group of CS Education researchers in the [ComputingEd@UW](http://computinged.uw.edu/) community who would love to get in touch with you.
