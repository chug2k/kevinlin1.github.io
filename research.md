> Are you a current **UW undergrad or CSE B.S./M.S. student** interested in working with me? Read this Allen School page on [Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/enrichment/research) and then email me about why you're interested in working on CS Education research with me.

> Are you a current or prospective **Ph.D student** interested in working with me? I do not formally advise Ph.D students, but we have a vibrant group of CS Education researchers in the [ComputingEd@UW](https://computinged.uw.edu/) community who would love to get in touch with you.

- [Making CS Learning Visible](https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319791). Exploring studio-based learning and self-directed assignments to replace the immense human expenditure needed for developing and grading highly standardized assignments.
- [Computer-Based Testing Facility](http://zilles.cs.illinois.edu/cbtf.html). Automated, frequent formative assessment as a means of deconstructing the fixed-time, fixed-learning model of the [US education system](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/thorndike-won-dewey-lost-the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-the-us-education-system/) and moving a step towards problem-centric and context-aware computing education.
- [Can Learning Be Fair?](http://calendar.washington.edu/140800140/AdvancesinHigherEducationResearchSeminarPracticingIntoInclusionUtilizingaLearningAssistantPedagogyCoursetoExploreandAddressImpactsofStructuralOppressiononLearning) Embedding equity, social justice, and social responsibility into the [values of CS education](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/21st-grand-challenges-for-computing-education-f5e937d57155) for students and teachers.

A formal list of research publications can be found in my [CV](/cv).
