Hi, I'm Kevin. I will be receiving an MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley
in Spring 2019. I am currently applying for CS teaching-track faculty and
lecturer jobs starting in Summer or Fall 2019.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'm very responsive over email: <kevinlin1@berkeley.edu>.
I'd love to discuss some of the challenges of teaching at Berkeley, and share
some of the techniques I've implemented which have helped scale courses while
improving our quality of service.

For ease of reference, my abridged application materials appear below.
