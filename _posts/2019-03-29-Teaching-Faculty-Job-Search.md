title: Teaching Faculty Job Search
excerpt: >
  A five year, non-traditional path into academia.
---

I will be receiving an MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in May 2019 and
intend to start a teaching-track faculty job in Fall 2019. Some of my friends
and students were curious as to how I got here, so I want to share most of my
application and interview materials. These materials are all dated 2018.

- [Curriculum vitae](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bv7aQF6cOye_Uq30hcubZV5oewOlo6DY).
- [Teaching statement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vCpS_KdDNBuvDxwi7Bt2IDbOYbNVM7yz).
- [Diversity statement](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Iu7SgtrIi_U9Kp870AwO7TkjSezXgXvC).

For students who are interested in following this path, I didn't start
seriously looking into teaching-track faculty jobs until my fourth year of
undergraduate study around the same time I applied to the 5th Year MS program.
But there is a [huge demand][capacity] for CS teachers at all levels.  CS
departments at the university level are also increasingly open to hiring
experienced teachers with master's degrees, though going directly from
completing a master's degree into a teaching faculty position is rare.  But I'm
certainly not the first to go down this track: a few colleagues include [Adam
Blank][], [Hunter Schafer][], and many others. The UW undergraduate TA program
in particular has been a trailblazer in this regard.

I believe that strong recommendation letters and a proven teaching record are
the most important attriutes for getting your foot in the door.  Of course,
having strong materials sets up a first impression about your teaching values
(and whether those values align with the hiring institution), and that you are
familiar with academic norms which can help offset potential concerns about
lacking a PhD. When I was preparing my materials, I chose to emphasize
strategies for teaching at scale since it was the thread that tied together all
of my work and matched with the institutions that truly interested me.

I am very lucky to have had the opportunity to lecture for CS courses twice
during my undergraduate career, though I believe you can do just as much (if
not more) great work as a TA. What is important is that your application
materials make clear your teaching experience and views. (And [don't just say
nice things about teaching][]---it's not about you, but what you can bring to
the hiring institution, and what differentiates you from other candidates.)

The teaching job talk is one of the most important events during the interview.
Unlike tenure-track positions which tend to follow a more standardized research
talk format, many schools put their own twist on the teaching job talk so I
mixed and matched presentations to prepare customized talks for each
institution, reusing materials where possible.

- [Effective Teaching at Scale][]---it is really a reflection of my approach
  that my teaching philosophy has very little to do with my own teaching.

For finding job listings, the [CRA Job Announcements][] page is by far the most
complete for candidates looking to teach at R1 universities. Based on my
informal records, there were well over 70 open listings for positions starting
in the 2019-2020 academic year, and about two-thirds of them required a
master's as the minimum degree. The [SIGCSE-members][] mailing list is also
useful for last-minute and special opportunities, but most of the major
listings were posted to the CRA ads list first.

For detailed views on the tenure-track faculty job search, plenty of other
folks have written about their experiences. I consulted [Philip Guo][] and
[Matt Welsh][].

I found the entire job search process incredibly enjoyable and a rare
opportunity to broaden my perspective through meeting over a hundred academics
in the span of a few months. I couldn't have asked for any better way to cap
off my five year project at UC Berkeley, and I am very grateful to the faculty,
staff, and students in the EECS Department for their perpetual support.
