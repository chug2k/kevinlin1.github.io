The **Design of the Problem Space** is a tool for educators and researchers to
better understand learners' experiences in different contexts, and how those
experiences change over time as the learner progress through a problem-solving
process. This is one snapshot of **two learners (ðŸ–¤1, ðŸ–¤2)** working together
to solve a problem.

1. To understand the problem space, it is necessary to account for learner's
   prior interactions and experience.
2. The larger, overall problem is subdivided into smaller **tasks** which the
   learner must complete to solve the problem. Each task is modelled here as a
solid circle.
   - **Planning Phase**: Tasks begin in the *planning phase* which involves the
     identification of tasks that need to be solved and the development of
ideas or strategies to solve the tasks. This can involve exploring the console,
recalling examples or information learned earlier, relying on a diagram to map
out mental processes, and then putting all of these ideas together into a plan
for the *building phase*.
   - **Building Phase**: Tasks then move onto the *building phase* where
     learners must implement their ideas, usually by implementing the code for
their plan. This can involve several smaller steps, drawing upon past coding
examples to assemble a valid series of computer instructions. The goal of this
phase is to compose a runnable program, though it may not meet the
specifications determined during the planning phase. What's left after building
is the *monitoring phase*.
   - **Monitoring Phase**: Tasks finally end up in the *monitoring phase* where
   the learner ensures that the task meets the specifications laid out in the
plan by debugging, testing, and evaluating the correctness of the program. At
this point, they may also realize that there was some earlier fault in their
plan which could also necessitate rewriting a large portion of the program.
3. The learner navigates the problem space, context-switching between tasks.
   The learner draws upon their **[Sources of Knowledge][]** (perception,
reason, testimony, introspection, memory) to develop ideas.
4. Each interaction between a learner and a task is a mediated process: the
   learner must plan out and execute an action, and then respond to feedback
from the system. In this example, the interaction is mediated by the debugger
which gives feedback from the computer to the learner, but is liable to
misinterpretation.
5. Not all interactions go smoothly. Each execution of an action requires
   crossing a gulf of execution, the gap between the user's goal and their
means or ability to execute that goal. A failure of communication occurs
between the two learners.
6. Likewise, there is a gulf of evaluation between the feedback from the
   diagram (mediated process) and the learner's ability to interpret the
feedback.
7. Finally, each interaction shapes the subsequent history of the problem
   space.
