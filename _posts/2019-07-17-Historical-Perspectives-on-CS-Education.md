I wanted to highlight [a post Alan Kay recently submitted][] to Mark Guzdial's
Computing Education blog.

That reminded me of a few other sources that might inspire some thought on the
debugging process and the social factors surrounding novices' experiences with
failure. Thanks to [David DeLiema](http://www.david-deliema.com) for these
suggestions.

- *Mindstorms* (Papert 1980).
- Language-independent conceptual "bugs" in novice programming (Pea 1986). More
  affectionately known as "Superbug".
- Cognitive objectives in a LOGO debugging curriculum: Instruction, learning,
  and transfer (Klahr, Carver 1988).
- Self-Efficacy Mechanism in Human Agency (Bandura 1982).

And an interesting piece of what would now be considered history with a
statement by Mike Clancy from the OOPSLA ["The Future of CS2 and Data
Structures" workshop](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/woduds/clancy.html). While
I'm tooting Mike's horn, here's a couple more interesting papers.

- Misconceptions and Attitudes that Interfere with Learning to Program (Clancy
  2004).
- Experiences with lab-centric instruction (Titterton, Lewis, Clancy 2009)

It's hard to put together all of these into a TL;DR version, but I'm making my
way through *How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart
Teaching* (Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro, Lovett, Norman 2010) on recommendation
from the UW CS Ed research seminar group and it deserves recognition.
Reflecting on teaching CS in higher education, a lot of the lessons in this
book feel incredibly relevant.
