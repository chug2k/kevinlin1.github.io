title: Programming a Better Future
excerpt: >-
  How computer scientists can undo the social dilemma.
---

I recently gave a prepared talk to introductory programming students reflecting on the nature of computer science's social and political responsibility.

**Techlash**: *The Social Dilemma* is an important documentary on techlash, though deeply problematic in how it references tech insiders rather than the important work done by leading researchers on algorithmic justice: Dr. Timnit Gebru, Joy Buolamwini, Dr. Rediet Abebe, Deb Raji, Mutale Nkonde, Dr. Ruha Benjamin, Dr. Simone Browne, and Dr. Safiya Noble.

- What does it mean for the "the art of computer programming" to serve mathematics?
- **Abstraction**: In Budgeter, you're tasked to build an algorithm that organizes people based on certain criteria, but fails to take into consideration formatting errors, [emergencies](https://youtu.be/h1NqpK4gDrM?t=1197), etc. What about a [hiring algorithm](https://ethicalcs.github.io/modules/hiring/stories.html) that asks questions about grades?

- How has the lack of political identity in computing shaped students' perceptions of the values of computing? Politics are inherent whenever we program with other users in mind.
- **Social implications of computing** (that technology impacts people) vs. **political implications of computing** (that different groups of people feel technology's impacts in unequal ways). Justice rather than ethics.

- **Research that Develops Foundational Technologies**: recent breakthrough on the traveling salesman problem, novel methods to store data in DNA, etc.
- **Research Focused on Direct World Impact**: AI/sensors for medicine, research on computing for the developing world, accessibility research, etc.
- **Research on Potential Negative Consequences of Technology**: understanding and fighting misinformation, trolling on social media, etc.
