> Interested in becoming a teaching assistant for one of my courses? Complete a [CSE TA Application](https://ta.cs.washington.edu/apply/) and address the following questions in your personal statement.
> - Why do you want to teach this course?
> - What is a significant hardship students face in this course?
> - Why do you think you would make a good TA for this course?
>
> The purpose of the personal statement is to make a **logical argument as to why you would succeed as a TA for this course**. The most effective personal statements draw on evidence from either student experience and/or teaching experience to substantiate claims. Successful applicants typically take three or more paragraphs to address these points, though this is not a hard requirement.
