## Teaching Tea Parties

Teaching tea parties are 4:30--5:20pm every Friday over Zoom. Teaching tea parties are low-key hangouts for unwinding at the end of the week with other folks in the [ComputingEd@UW](https://computinged.uw.edu/) community. Drop by whenever you want to chat about teaching, catch up on life, share what you've been working on, or see our friendly faces! The format of these meetings is mostly unstructured, so feel free to join with your other work or food on the side, but don't expect to get much deep work done.

To participate, message me on the [ComputingEd@UW Slack](http://computinged-uw.slack.com/) or ask an attendee to share the calendar invitation with you. Everyone in the University of Washington community is welcome!

## University of Washington

**Interested in being a teaching assistant for my course?** For CSE 14X, complete a [CSE 14X TA Application](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/). For all other courses, complete a [CSE TA Application](https://ta.cs.washington.edu/apply/) and address the following points in your personal statement.

- Why do you want to teach this course?
- Describe a college classroom experience that was particularly effective or ineffective.
- Why would you be an effective TA for this course?

The purpose of the personal statement is to make an argument as to why you would succeed as a TA by demonstrating fluency with the challenges of teaching university computer science. I read your personal statement with the intention of sparking conversation around your ideas on computer science education. Note that your personal statement can be seen by all instructors reviewing your application, so if you're interested in teaching other courses, make sure your personal statement also makes sense to other instructors.
