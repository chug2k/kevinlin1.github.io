[Recruiter? TL;DR? Resume.](/resume)

Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a computer science educator, student, and wannabe
researcher.

I study and implement scalable teaching and learning techniques for CS 61A at
UC Berkeley, one of the largest in-person computer science courses in the
world. This past summer, I had the incredible honor of joining the family of
summer lecturers for [CS 61A](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su17/) at UC
Berkeley.

In my spare time, I also study [Computer
Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) and
[Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Studying is,
admittedly, not as fun as teaching.

Whatever little time I have left I spend designing websites for [Berkeley
Diversity](http://diversity.berkeley.edu). My boss, [Kim
Steinbacher](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2005/08/03_steinbacher.shtml),
really inspires me!

In the past, I've also taught [Data Structures](http://datastructur.es/sp17/)
with [mom and dad](http://www.cs61bl.org/su16/staff.html) and [the
Josh](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/joshhug.html).
