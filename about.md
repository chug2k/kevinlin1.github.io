[Recruiter? TL;DR? Resume.](/resume)

Hi, I'm Kevin. Starting Fall 2018, I'll be pursuing a 5th year MS in EECS at UC
Berkeley in the area of computer science eduation, advised by [John DeNero][]
and [Josh Hug][]. I also work with the [Embodied Design Research Lab][EDRL] in
the Educational Psychology department on the practice and theory of programming
and debugging. It's been an incredibly humbling and inspiring experience
working alongside everyone these past few years and I'm excited to continue
expanding access to computer science education.

I'll be graduating in Spring 2019 and applying primarily for teaching-track
faculty and lecturer jobs.

My goal is to find ways to make course material more personally relevant to
students. Teaching at the university level, in my mind, has never been about
the *teaching*: it's more about finding a compelling a narrative and context
for students to engage with the material and then providing students the right
pathways and support to make their own learning possible. That, along with
building the right connections with my staff to convey this vision, is what I'm
most proud of achieving my first time as a lecturer for CS 61A.

During my undergraduate career, I was an undergraduate student instructor (UGSI
and a.k.a. TA) for 8 semesters. I studied and implemented scalable teaching and
learning techniques for CS 61A (CS 1) and CS 61B (CS 2) at UC Berkeley, two of
the largest in-person computer science courses in the world.  This past summer,
I had the incredible honor of joining the family of summer lecturers for [CS
61A][] at UC Berkeley, and I am returning this summer to teach [CS 61BL][] and
close the loop, ending where [I started][CS 61BL SU16 Staff].

In Fall 2018, I will be teaching CS 61C as the Head Teaching Assistant for [Dan
Garcia][], as well as expanding access to the course by launching a new elective,
small-group mentorship program for students in the course. With the (nearly
non-existent) free time I have left, I will be researching and evaluating our
methods for teaching at scale, from both a software perspective and a human
interaction perspective.

In Spring 2018, I was the president of [Computer Science Mentors][], a student
organization composed of undergraduate students who volunteer their time and
energy to teach other undergraduate students. During my time, I helped scale
the organization over two-fold, from a group of 100(!) mentors to a family of
over 200(!!) mentors, serving over 1500 undergraduate EE and CS students. A
particular priority of mines was in building better experiences for mentors by
creating more opportunities for interpersonal relationships and branching out
in different social or work-related directions.

I was a part of the very first cohort of students in CSM Spring 2015. [It
inspired me.][Year One]

I also recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in both [Computer
Science][] and [Cognitive Science][].

I previously worked with [Berkeley Diversity][] to reimagine their web presence
and user experience. I have experience working with them for several years
iterating on different designs and implementing the frontend and backend
components to help tell compelling stories. My boss, [Kim Steinbacher][],
really inspires me!
