Hi, I'm Kevin. Starting Fall 2019, I will be a Lecturer in the Paul G. Allen
School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.

I completed a BA and MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in the area of
computer science eduation, advised by [John DeNero][] and in close
collaboration with [Josh Hug][] and [Dan Garcia][]. During this time, I also
worked with [David DeLiema][] in the [Embodied Design Research Lab][EDRL] in
the Educational Psychology department to better understand the process through
which newcomers to programming experience programming and debugging problem
solving. I am also interested in designing pathways to encourage the
development of [pre-service K--12 CS teachers](/csp).

My goal is to find ways to make course material more personally relevant to
students. Teaching at the university level, in my mind, has never been about
the *teaching*. It's about finding a compelling a narrative and context for
students to engage with the material and then providing students the right
pathways and support to make their own learning possible. That, along with
building the right connections with my staff to convey this vision, is what I'm
most proud of achieving as a lecturer for [CS 61A][] and [CS 61BL][].

During my undergraduate career, I was an undergraduate student instructor
(teaching assistant) for 8 semesters. I studied and implemented scalable
teaching and learning techniques for CS 61A (CS 1.5) and CS 61B (CS 2) at UC
Berkeley. Most recently, I helped run all aspects of course operations in CS
61C (CS 3). I have been on a "TA sabbatical" this Spring 2019 while away on the
[teaching faculty job search](/recruiting).

In Spring 2018, I served as President of [Computer Science Mentors][], a
student organization composed of undergraduate students who teach other
undergraduate students. During my time, I scaled the organization over
two-fold, from a group of 100 mentors to a family of over 200 mentors, in total
serving over 1500 undergraduate EE and CS students. A particular priority of
mines was in improving the experience for mentors by creating more
opportunities to develop interpersonal relationships through the family system
and in branching out services to improve mentor training and support their
long-term goals.

I was part of the very first cohort of students in CSM Spring 2015. [It
inspired me.][Year One]
