[Recruiter? TL;DR? Resume.](/resume)

Hi, I'm Kevin. Starting Fall 2018, I'll be pursuing a 5th year MS in EECS at UC
Berkeley in the area of computer science eduation, advised by [John DeNero][]
and [Josh Hug][]. It's been an incredibly humbling and inspiring experience
working alongside them these past few years and I'm excited to see where we'll
go next and create a more beautiful future.

During my undergraduate career, I studied and implemented scalable teaching and
learning techniques for CS 61A (CS 1) and CS 61B (CS 2) at UC Berkeley, two of
the largest in-person computer science courses in the world. This past summer,
I had the incredible honor of joining the family of summer lecturers for [CS
61A][] at UC Berkeley, and I hope to return this summer to teach [CS 61BL][]
and close the loop, ending where [I started][CS 61BL SU16 Staff].

And, though I'm not doing a particularly good job, I'm the current president of
[Computer Science Mentors][]. I was a part of the very first cohort of students
in CSM Spring 2015. [It inspired me.][Year One]

In my spare time, I also study [Computer Science][] and [Cognitive Science][]
at UC Berkeley. Studying is, admittedly, not as fun as teaching.

Whatever little time I have left I spend designing websites for [Berkeley
Diversity][]. My boss, [Kim Steinbacher][], really inspires me!
