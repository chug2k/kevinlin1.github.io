[Recruiter? TL;DR? Resume.](/resume)

Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm a computer science educator, student, and wannabe researcher.

This summer, I'm really proud to join the family of summer lecturers for [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://cs61a.org) at UC Berkeley. If you're a student in the class this summer, hello there! Let's learn a lot and make this an amazing summer!

In my spare time, I also study [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate/cs-ba) and [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Studying is, admittedly, not as fun as teaching.

Whatever time I have left I spend designing websites for [Berkeley Diversity](http://diversity.berkeley.edu). My boss, [Kim Steinbacher](http://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2005/08/03_steinbacher.shtml), really inspires me!

In the past, I've also taught [Data Structures](http://datastructur.es/sp17/) with [mom and dad](http://www.cs61bl.org/su16/staff.html) and [the Josh](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/joshhug.html). I will also be teaching CS 61C this summer in spirit, meaning I'll probably just drop in on labs, act like a ghost and scare students away while espousing the virtues of floating point representation. It's pretty fun: you should try it.
