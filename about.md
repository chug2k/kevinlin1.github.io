Hi, I'm Kevin. I teach large computer science courses in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and also help lead the [ComputingEd@UW][] community.

I completed a BA and MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in the area of computer science eduation, advised by [John DeNero][] and in close collaboration with [Josh Hug][] and [Dan Garcia][]. During this time, I also worked with [David DeLiema][] in the [Embodied Design Research Lab][EDRL] in the Educational Psychology department to better understand the process through which newcomers to programming solve problems. I am also interested in designing pathways to encourage the development of [pre-service K--12 CS teachers](/csp).

My main interest is in the practice of teaching computer science at the university level. My goal is to find ways to make course material more personally relevant to students. Teaching at the university level, in my mind, has never been about the *teaching*. It's about finding a compelling a narrative and context for students to engage with the material and then providing the right pathways and support to make their own learning possible. That, along with building the right connections with my staff to convey this vision, is what I'm most proud of achieving as a lecturer for [CS 61A][] and [CS 61BL][].

During my undergraduate career, I was teaching assistant for 8 semesters. I studied and implemented scalable teaching and learning techniques for CS 61A (CS1.5), CS 61B (CS2), and CS 61C (CS3) at UC Berkeley.

In Spring 2018, I served as President of [Computer Science Mentors][], a student organization composed of undergraduate students who teach other undergraduate students. During my time, I scaled the organization over two-fold, from a group of 100 mentors to a family of over 200 mentors, in total serving over 1500 undergraduate EE and CS students. A particular priority of mines was in improving the experience for mentors by creating more opportunities to develop interpersonal relationships through the family system and in branching out services to improve mentor training and support their long-term goals.
