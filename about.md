Hi, I'm Kevin. I am a master's candidate in EECS at UC Berkeley in the area of
computer science eduation, advised by [John DeNero][] and [Josh Hug][]. I also
work with the [Embodied Design Research Lab][EDRL] in the Educational
Psychology department on understanding the ways in which novices practice and
experience programming and debugging. I expect to graduate in Spring 2019 and
intend to accept a teaching-track faculty and lecturer job for Fall 2019.

My goal is to find ways to make course material more personally relevant to
students. Teaching at the university level, in my mind, has never been about
the *teaching*: it's about finding a compelling a narrative and context for
students to engage with the material and then providing students the right
pathways and support to make their own learning possible. That, along with
building the right connections with my staff to convey this vision, is what I'm
most proud of achieving as a lecturer for [CS 61A][] and [CS 61BL][].

During my undergraduate career, I was an undergraduate student instructor
(teaching assistant) for 8 semesters. I studied and implemented scalable
teaching and learning techniques for CS 61A (CS 1) and CS 61B (CS 2) at UC
Berkeley, two of the largest in-person computer science courses in the world.
Most recently, I helped run all aspects of course operations in CS 61C (CS 3)
with [Dan Garcia][], including expanding accessibility to the course by
launching a new elective, small-group mentorship program for students in the
course.

In Spring 2018, I served as President of [Computer Science Mentors][], a student
organization composed of undergraduate students who volunteer to teach other
undergraduate students. During my time, I helped scale the organization over
two-fold, from a group of 100 mentors to a family of over 200 mentors,
in total serving over 1500 undergraduate EE and CS students. A particular
priority of mines was in improving the experience for mentors by creating more
opportunities to develop interpersonal relationships through the family system
and in branching out services to improve mentor training and support their
long-term goals.

I was a part of the very first cohort of students in CSM Spring 2015. [It
inspired me.][Year One]

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a BA in [Computer Science][] and
[Cognitive Science][]. I previously worked with [Berkeley Diversity][] to
reimagine their web presence and user experience, iterating on different
designs and implementing the frontend and backend components to tell compelling
stories.

## Bio

Kevin Lin is a master's candidate in the Electrical Engineering and Computer
Sciences department at UC Berkeley. He coordinates the teaching and development
of large-scale, introductory undergraduate CS courses which, in total, support
enrollments of over 3,500 students each year. His research focuses on computer
science education with a particular emphasis on methods for broadening
participation and retention in classrooms of all sizes.
