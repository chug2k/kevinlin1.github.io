I care about {{ site.description | downcase }}

- [Making CS Learning Visible](https://doi.org/10.1145/3304221.3319791). Exploring studio-based learning, self-directed assignments, and alternative assessment to replace the immense human expenditure spent on highly standardized assignments.
- Alternative, authentic, formative assessment as a means of deconstructing the fixed-time, fixed-learning model of the [US education system](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/01/27/thorndike-won-dewey-lost-the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-the-us-education-system/) and moving towards problem-centric and context-aware computing education.
- [Can Learning Be Fair?](https://youtu.be/MnRZcPeEAv0) Embedding equity, social justice, and social responsibility into the [values of CS education](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/21st-grand-challenges-for-computing-education-f5e937d57155) for students and teachers.

## Get involved

Are you a current or prospective **UW undergrad or CSE BS/MS student**?

Teaching
: See also [CSE 492T: Equitable and Inclusive Computer Science Pedagogy](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse492t/).
: For CSE 14X, complete a [CSE 14X TA Application](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/).
: For all other courses, complete a [CSE TA Application](https://ta.cs.washington.edu/apply/) and address the following points in your personal statement. It doesn't need to be particularly long. I'm mostly interested in getting a sense of your values as a teacher.

  - Describe what you think is the most important role of a teaching assistant.
  - Analyze a school experience you found particularly effective or ineffective.

Research
: Learn more [about me]({% link about.md %}) and read about [Undergraduate Research](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/enrichment/research) in the Allen School. Then, tell me why you're interested in working on CS education.

BS/MS
: The Allen School teaching professors are creating a [BS/MS Teaching Focus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_NOnBeXRqzxYkUaGz7aUbGA1fLy87sMfINpFO01Myo/preview) preparing students for teaching careers in computer science (esp. higher-ed).

Are you a current or prospective **PhD student**? I do not formally advise Ph.D students, but there are plenty of others in [ComputingEd@UW](https://computinged.uw.edu/) who'd love to get to know you. Amy Ko has published an overview of [Computing Education Research](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer) at UW and beyond.

### Teaching Tea Parties

Teaching tea parties are low-key hangouts for unwinding at the end of the week with other folks in the [ComputingEd@UW](https://computinged.uw.edu/) community meeting 4:30--5:20pm every Friday over Zoom. Drop by whenever you want to chat about teaching, catch up on life, share what you've been working on, or see our friendly faces! The format of these meetings is mostly unstructured, so feel free to join with your other work or food on the side, but don't expect to get much deep work done.

To participate, message me on the [ComputingEd@UW Slack](http://computinged-uw.slack.com/) or ask an attendee to share the calendar invitation with you. Everyone in the University of Washington community is welcome!
