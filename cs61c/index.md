## Resources

- Richard Feynman's *Lectures on Computation* and, in particular,
  *[Introduction to Computation][]* is a fantastic introduction to the first
few weeks
- Imperial Violet's [RISC-V Assembly][] blog post, and the full [RISC-V
  Specification][]

### Guides

> Josh's CS 61B [Exam Studying Guide][] is fantastic. I wrote the CS 61A
> [Studying Guide][] which has a few more tips for general problem-solving.
